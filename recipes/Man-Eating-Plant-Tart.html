<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A tart-like dish created by Senshi from the fruit of different Man-eating Plants. Described as salty by the group, it is likely to be more akin to a quiche but with an inedible shell.
     A mixture of mashed up and cut up Man-Eating Plant fruit, slime and scorpion soup is poured into a pan lined with the flattened peel of the fruit and cooked before garnishing with some more fruit.
